    <h1>The classic italian mushroom risotto</h1>
    <h3>20min prep | 25min cook time | 6 servings</h3>

    <p>Authentic Italian-style risotto cooked the slow and painful way, but-oh so worth it. 
        Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well. Check the rice by biting 
        into it. It should be slightly al dente (or resist slightly to the tooth but not 
        be hard in the center). </p>

    <h4> Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cup chicken broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil </li>
        <li>500g portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>500g white mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 medium shallots, diced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups arborio rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>3 tbsp finely chopped chives</li>
        <li>1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Method:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat.</li>
        <li>warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over 
            medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; 
            cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove 
            mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the 
            saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. 
            Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with 
            oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully 
            absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir 
            until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth, 
            1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the 
            liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to 
            the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their 
            liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese. Season with 
            salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
