    <h1>the creamiest carbonara you can find!</h1>
    <h3>12min prep | 12min cook time | 4 servings</h3>

    <p>This recipe is one of Australia's top-rated spaghetti 
        carbonara recipes, and we can see why. Although it breaks 
        from the traditional Italian recipe by including cream, 
        it's incredibly easy to make with only a handful of ingredients.
    </p>
    <h4> Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>400g spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil </li>
        <li>200g sliced pancetta</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 eggs, plus 1 yolk</li>
        <li>100ml thicken cream</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (50g) grated parmesan</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped parsley leaves</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Method:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the 
            packet instructions. Meanwhile, heat oil in a frypan over medium heat. 
            Cook pancetta, stirring, for 2-3 minutes until beginning to crisp. 
            Add garlic for 30 seconds, then set pan aside.</li>
        <li>Place eggs, yolk, cream and parmesan in a bowl. Season, then mix gently with a fork.
             Drain pasta, then return to pan. Quickly add egg and pancetta mixtures and parsley. 
             Toss to combine - the heat from the pasta will cook the egg slightly and form a creamy sauce.
              Serve immediately with extra parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
